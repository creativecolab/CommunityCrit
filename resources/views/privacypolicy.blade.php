    <p><strong>Title: Facilitating Decision-Making Through Technology</strong></p>

    <p><strong><em>Who is conducting the study, why you have been asked to participate, how you were selected, and what is the approximate number of participants in the study?</em></strong><br>
    Dr. Steven Dow, and Dr. Narges Mahyar are conducting a research study to find out more about group decision-making. You have been asked to participate in this study because you are at least 18 years old and you signed up voluntarily. There will be approximately 60 participants in this study.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Why is this study being done?</em></strong><br>
    The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of public engagement methods and how public can be part of decision-making processes related to their communities. We will conduct a series of studies to understand how social computing tools, such as CommunityCrit, can better facilitate feedback exchange and decision-making.</p>

    <p><strong><em>What will happen to you in this study and which procedures are standard of care and which are experimental?</em></strong><br>
    If you agree to be in this study, you will be asked to use an online tool, CommunityCrit, to provide feedback on alternative urban planning proposals.</p>

    <p><strong><em>How much time will each study procedure take, what is your total time commitment, and how long will the study last?</em></strong><br>
    This study will take around 30 minutes.</p>

    <p><strong><em>What risks are associated with this study?</em></strong><br>
    Participation in this study may involve some added risks or discomforts. These include the following: A potential for the loss of confidentiality; we will ensure that only the research team can access thevideo/audio recording and other data. All participantsâ€™ data will be erased after the research period. Research records will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by law. Research records may bereviewed by the UCSD Institutional Review Board. Because this is a research study, there may also be some unknown risks that are currently unforeseeable. You will be informed of any significant new findings.</p>

    <p><strong><em>What are the alternatives to participating in this study?</em></strong><br>
    The alternative to participation in this study is not to participate.</p>

    <p><strong><em>What benefits can be reasonably expected?</em></strong><br>
    There may or may not be any direct benefit to you from participating this study. Potential benefits forparticipants may also include getting information about new proposals and empowering them (especially those who cannot attend workshops and other face to face events) to voice their concerns through the online platforms. The investigator, may learn more about different methods to design an online tool for effective feedback exchange and get the feedback from our current design. Besides, society may benefit from this knowledge.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Can you choose to not participate or withdraw from the study without penalty or loss of benefits?</em></strong><br>
    Participation in research is entirely voluntary.
