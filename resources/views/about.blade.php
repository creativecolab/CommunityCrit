                <h1>About CommunityCrit</h1>
                <p>CommunityCrit allows the public to learn about urban design proposals and give feedback. [more about the platform]</p>

                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>We are a team of researchers in the Design Lab at the University of California San Diego. Our goal is to develop technologies that enable people to share their ideas about designing the future of their communities. We hope that our online tool, CommunityCrit, will facilitate community participation and supplement traditional face-to-face workshops to get broader feedback on urban design projects.</p><p>We have chosen the recent planning efforts around the extension of the 14th Street Promenade in the East Village neighborhood of downtown San Diego as our test case.</p>
