                <h1>About CommunityCrit</h1>
                <p>In 2016, the City of San Diego approved the 14th Street Promenade plan to transform the stretch of 14th Street between City College and National Avenue into a green street. Now, an extension of this project—called the Park-to-Park project—is being considered. The Park-to-Park project would extend the City’s approved 14th Street Promenade north to Balboa Park and south-east to Chicano Park in Barrio Logan.</p><p>Earlier this summer, we attended a public planning workshop in San Diego about the Park-to-Park project. While the workshop was successful, we found that participation in face-to-face meetings is often complicated by difficulties attending the workshops, challenges speaking up, time constraints, and lack of follow-up. Our online tool, CommunityCrit, will allow participants to contribute their voices to the planning and design process, all on their own time.</p><p>CommunityCrit enables the public to collectively design an urban design proposal, offering a quick and convenient way for anyone to voice their concerns, suggest alternatives, and share their values. CommunityCrit gives people feedback activities based on their interests and available time, so they have the opportunity to help develop a community proposal.</p>

                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>We are a team of researchers in the Design Lab at the University of California San Diego. Our goal is to develop technologies that enable people to share their ideas about designing the future of their communities. We hope that our online tool, CommunityCrit, will facilitate community participation and supplement traditional face-to-face workshops to get broader feedback on urban design projects.</p><p>We have chosen the recent planning efforts around the extension of the 14th Street Promenade in the East Village neighborhood of downtown San Diego as our test case.</p>
