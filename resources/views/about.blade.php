    <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>We are a team of researchers in the Design Lab at the University of California San Diego, led by Professor Steven Dow and Dr. Narges Mahyar. Our goal is to develop technologies that enable people to co-design the future of their communities.</p>We have created CommunityCrit (short for Community Critique) to facilitate community participation, supplement traditional face-to-face workshops, and collect broader feedback on urban design projects. We have chosen the recent planning efforts around the 14th Street Promenade in the East Village neighborhood of downtown San Diego as our test case.</p>
