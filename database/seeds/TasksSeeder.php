					'text' => 'East Village from its beginning has continually reinvented itself, but at its roots, it is a community with strong ties to education, innovation and creativity. At the turn of the century, East Village was a warehouse district providing support to the port, consisting of warehouse buildings and switching yards. It was a working class neighborhood, rich with industry. Over the years it evolved into a central provider for social services to all of San Diego. And in the 1980’s and 1990’s artists ocked to the area to establish opportunities for live- work lofts. This is the place of Bob Sinclair, a local resident, entrepreneur, and collector, who valued the architecture and history of the neighborhood. He encouraged other entrepreneurs and filled his buildings in East Village with new, creative tenants. With this tie to innovation and history is also East Village’s strong connection to education. The urban art trail was a project envisioned by a City College professor wishing to bring art to the community through painting utility boxes and designing murals on building facades and sidewalks. That tie to education continues with the establishment of new schools such as New School Of Architecture, Urban Discovery Academy and the Thomas Jefferson School of Law. The three districts outlined in the Master Plan celebrate the past and bring forward the future of the neighborhood creating an urban trail that is uniquely East Village. This is where history unites with today’s modern working neighborhood and continues to promote innovation, design, education and art. The design of the 14th Street Promenade will accommodate a variety of passive and active recreation activities, ranging from walking and resting to more activated uses such as children’s discovery areas, local art displays, sensory play areas, historical artifacts, and other design elements. The Master Plan for the 14th Street Promenade is based on a series of three branded, context-driven districts, focusing on San Diego and East Village design expression.',

					'text' => 'Entertainment and Innovation District – the four blocks at the South end of the 14th Street Promenade (between J Street and National Avenue) will become an Entertainment and Innovation District. Because it is near many waterfront industrial uses, design in this zone will celebrate the history of industry and innovation in San Diego. The 14th Street Promenade will include exible spaces that can be programmed for varied uses and integrating historical artifacts and interpretive elements. A variety of seating opportunities are provided and plantings will accent the streetscape with color and shade. The Entertainment and Innovation District will showcase unique artifacts of East Village’s history including the display of Bob Sinclair artifacts in creative and functional ways.',

				[
					'text' => 'Park District Park District – the central four blocks (between F Street and J Street) are bookended with the future East Village Green and new Fault Line Park, and the two middle blocks consist of residential and commercial uses. This Park District will provide a green oasis that connects the two parks. Adjacent to the residential blocks between G Street and Island Avenue are areas designed for a variety of seating opportunities and places for active outdoor exercise. The plant palette emphasizes the tree canopy and understory plants with a range of colors and textures.',
				],
				[
					'text' => 'Urban Discovery and Play District – the three northernmost blocks (between C Street and F Street) comprise the Urban Discovery and Play District. It is anchored by City College in the north and Urban Discovery Academy in the south. This zone encourages discovery and creativity, with opportunities to learn, relax and explore. It is characterized by seating for people to simply relax and enjoy views toward the Bay, and interactive elements representing historical information about the history of San Diego and the East Village. Landscape plantings allow exploration and discovery, and include native plants that have been used traditionally in Kumeyaay culture, reflecting that there is a long history to the region.',

The planting plan will dominate the corridor creating an inviting space for a variety of uses, yet allowing visual access to the Promenade for policing and easy access for maintenance. Plantings on the east side of the street will occur mostly in the furnishing zone, keeping the thru-way zone clear for pedestrian traffic. Plantings in the frontage zone are encouraged on both sides of the street.</p><ul><li><b>Street Trees</b> - proposed street trees will conform to all requirements in the Streetscape Manual. Additional trees are listed in the individual district plant palettes and will be used as accent to the dominant street tree. Canopy trees will comprise a majority of the Promenade planting, creating shade and a green oasis. Trees will be located in the furnishing zone and at specific locations as shown on the plans.<li><b>Parking Lot Screening</b> – plants located in the frontage zone will provide a green visual buffer at surface parking lots. Plants should be a combination of canopy trees and low growing shrubs in order to maintain sight lines.</li><li><b>Plantings in the Frontage Zone</b> – opportunities for plantings should be provided , where possible, between the building’s set back and/or entrance and the public right-of-way. These areas provide visual interest, integrate the architecture with the pedestrian zone, may be used for wayfinding, and may also be developed to manage storm water runoff.</li><li><b>Hanging Baskets and Planters</b> – accent plantings in hanging baskets or planters offer an opportunity to incorporate plants in existing right-of-ways where there is limited space for planting. Planters should be located in the frontage zone adjacent to building facades. Hanging baskets may be located on street lights poles in the furnishing zone. Planters in the furnishing zone will be evaluated on a case by case basis.<li><b>Green Walls</b> – green walls are a means of adding plants in areas with limited space and can be used to create a dramatic vertical design element.</li></ul>'

Concrete walkways will be located in the frontage and thru-way zone with the decomposed granite path located in the furnishing zone. Existing improved sidewalks will remain throughout the streetscape. The addition of the Promenade will protect in place these existing sidewalks, and the new trail and amenities, where applicable, will extend from the back of the existing curb into the public right-of-way. In areas where the sidewalk has not been improved, the sidewalk shall follow the guidelines in the Streetscape Manual for color and pattern and the new trail and amenities will become integral to the overall design of the pedestrian realm.'

This design will continue that with that tradition by adding unique gateway elements that will define the three individual districts.</li><li><b>Building Signs</b> – creative signs on buildings are encourage to accent the pedestrian zone</li><li><b>Banners</b> - Banners on building facades and light poles can define the Promenade and add visual interest to the corridor</li></ul>'

The design will further the Centre City Green program, which emphasizes the following:</p><ul><li>Transform downtown streets into places for people and not just for cars</li><li>Create healthier outdoor spaces that are more pedestrian- and bike-friendly, add more greenery, accommodate transit, use less energy and water, improve air quality and reduce storm water pollution</li><li>Devote less of the street right-of-way to vehicles and instead widen sidewalks</li><li>Where possible, incorporate low-impact development (LID) features that include storm water management systems</li><li>Use local and regional materials with high recycled content and energy-efficient pedestrian lighting.</li></ul><p>In addition, the 14th Street Promenade will utilize bioswales and porous paving to capture storm water from the roadway, sidewalks and rooftops of adjacent buildings. The bioswales will be planted with plant material appropriate for this condition and will be a prominent attractive feature of the 14th Street Promenade. Opportunity also exists for including interpretive elements within the bioswales to help the pedestrians appreciate the importance of stormwater quality.</p>',
