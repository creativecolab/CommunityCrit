					'text' => '<p><h2>Introduction</h2></p>East Village from its beginning has continually reinvented itself, but at its roots, it is a community with strong ties to education, innovation and creativity. At the turn of the century, East Village was a warehouse district providing support to the port, consisting of warehouse buildings and switching yards. It was a working class neighborhood, rich with industry. Over the years it evolved into a central provider for social services to all of San Diego. And in the 1980’s and 1990’s artists ocked to the area to establish opportunities for live- work lofts. This is the place of Bob Sinclair, a local resident, entrepreneur, and collector, who valued the architecture and history of the neighborhood. He encouraged other entrepreneurs and filled his buildings in East Village with new, creative tenants. With this tie to innovation and history is also East Village’s strong connection to education. The urban art trail was a project envisioned by a City College professor wishing to bring art to the community through painting utility boxes and designing murals on building facades and sidewalks. That tie to education continues with the establishment of new schools such as New School Of Architecture, Urban Discovery Academy and the Thomas Jefferson School of Law. The three districts outlined in the Master Plan celebrate the past and bring forward the future of the neighborhood creating an urban trail that is uniquely East Village. This is where history unites with today’s modern working neighborhood and continues to promote innovation, design, education and art. The design of the 14th Street Promenade will accommodate a variety of passive and active recreation activities, ranging from walking and resting to more activated uses such as children’s discovery areas, local art displays, sensory play areas, historical artifacts, and other design elements. The Master Plan for the 14th Street Promenade is based on a series of three branded, context-driven districts, focusing on San Diego and East Village design expression.',

				[
					'text' => '<p><h2>Entertainment and Innovation District</h2></p>Entertainment and Innovation District – the four blocks at the South end of the 14th Street Promenade (between J Street and National Avenue) will become an Entertainment and Innovation District. Because it is near many waterfront industrial uses, design in this zone will celebrate the history of industry and innovation in San Diego. The 14th Street Promenade will include exible spaces that can be programmed for varied uses and integrating historical artifacts and interpretive elements. A variety of seating opportunities are provided and plantings will accent the streetscape with color and shade. The Entertainment and Innovation District will showcase unique artifacts of East Village’s history including the display of Bob Sinclair artifacts in creative and functional ways.',
				],
				[
					'text' => '<p><h2>Park District</h2></p>Park District – the central four blocks (between F Street and J Street) are bookended with the future East Village Green and new Fault Line Park, and the two middle blocks consist of residential and commercial uses. This Park District will provide a green oasis that connects the two parks. Adjacent to the residential blocks between G Street and Island Avenue are areas designed for a variety of seating opportunities and places for active outdoor exercise. The plant palette emphasizes the tree canopy and understory plants with a range of colors and textures.',
				],
				[
					'text' => '<p><h2>Urban Discovery and Play District</h2></p>Urban Discovery and Play District – the three northernmost blocks (between C Street and F Street) comprise the Urban Discovery and Play District. It is anchored by City College in the north and Urban Discovery Academy in the south. This zone encourages discovery and creativity, with opportunities to learn, relax and explore. It is characterized by seating for people to simply relax and enjoy views toward the Bay, and interactive elements representing historical information about the history of San Diego and the East Village. Landscape plantings allow exploration and discovery, and include native plants that have been used traditionally in Kumeyaay culture, reflecting that there is a long history to the region.',
				],
				[
					'text' => '<p><h2>Continuous Promenade Elements</h2></p>Uniting the three districts, are features that are continuous throughout the Promenade. These include the following:',
				],
				[
					'text' => '<p><b>Planting</b> – Although district plant palettes differ, the 14th Street Promenade will feature additional canopy trees and low growing, low water-use, low maintenance, colorful understory plantings. The planting plan will dominate the corridor creating an inviting space for a variety of uses, yet allowing visual access to the Promenade for policing and easy access for maintenance. Plantings on the east side of the street will occur mostly in the furnishing zone, keeping the thru-way zone clear for pedestrian traffic. Plantings in the frontage zone are encouraged on both sides of the street.</p><ul><li><b>Street Trees</b> - proposed street trees will conform to all requirements in the Streetscape Manual. Additional trees are listed in the individual district plant palettes and will be used as accent to the dominant street tree. Canopy trees will comprise a majority of the Promenade planting, creating shade and a green oasis. Trees will be located in the furnishing zone and at specific locations as shown on the plans.<li><b>Parking Lot Screening</b> – plants located in the frontage zone will provide a green visual buffer at surface parking lots. Plants should be a combination of canopy trees and low growing shrubs in order to maintain sight lines.</li><li><b>Plantings in the Frontage Zone</b> – opportunities for plantings should be provided , where possible, between the building’s set back and/or entrance and the public right-of-way. These areas provide visual interest, integrate the architecture with the pedestrian zone, may be used for wayfinding, and may also be developed to manage storm water runoff.</li><li><b>Hanging Baskets and Planters</b> – accent plantings in hanging baskets or planters offer an opportunity to incorporate plants in existing right-of-ways where there is limited space for planting. Planters should be located in the frontage zone adjacent to building facades. Hanging baskets may be located on street lights poles in the furnishing zone. Planters in the furnishing zone will be evaluated on a case by case basis.<li><b>Green Walls</b> – green walls are a means of adding plants in areas with limited space and can be used to create a dramatic vertical design element.</li></ul>',
				],
				[
				
					'text' => '<b>Paving</b> – Concrete walkways and decomposed granite paths will comprise a common ground plane along the 14th Street Promenade. Concrete walkways will be located in the frontage and thru-way zone with the decomposed granite path located in the furnishing zone. Existing improved sidewalks will remain throughout the streetscape. The addition of the Promenade will protect in place these existing sidewalks, and the new trail and amenities, where applicable, will extend from the back of the existing curb into the public right-of-way. In areas where the sidewalk has not been improved, the sidewalk shall follow the guidelines in the Streetscape Manual for color and pattern and the new trail and amenities will become integral to the overall design of the pedestrian realm.',

				[
					'text' => '<p><b>Outdoor Furniture</b> – The outdoor furniture shall be consistent throughout the promenade, yet opportunities exist to accent the public space with unique pieces.</p></p><ul><li><b>Benches</b> – benches shall be designed to discourage lying down. They shall be constructed of metal, concrete or recycled, wood alternative materials.</li><li><b>Movable Seating</b> – café style seating is encouraged and shall be provided and maintained by adjacent businesses.</li><li><b>Trash Receptacles</b> – receptacles shall conform to the color and type listed in the Streetscape Manual and shall be located at the end of each block per the Manual.</li><li><b>Bike Racks</b> – Bike racks shall be located on every block and shall be the type listed in the Streetscape Manual.</li><li><b>Recreation Elements</b> – opportunities to incorporate creative and/or traditional recreation equipment shall be located in every block. Examples may include:<ul><li>Outdoor exercise equipment</li><li>Sensory play equipment</li><li>Individual and group seating</li></ul></li></ul>',
				],
				[
					'text' => '<b>Bollards</b> - Bollards define space and create a visual barrier between pedestrian and vehicular traffic.',
				],
				[
					'text' => '<b>Railings and Fencing</b> - Railings and fencing provide a physical barrier and a visual barrier to elements along the streetscape. Fencing shall be used to screen utilities on adjacent buildings and provide security for private access. Railings may be designed to provide a designation of space for a specific use. All fencing and railings shall conform to the guidelines in the Streetscape Manual and Downtown Design Guidelines. Creative treatments and designs shall be encouraged.'
				],
				[
					'text' => '<p><b>Signage</b> - Signage shall be provided throughout the Promenade and may include:</p><ul><li><b>Wayfinding</b> – a means of informing the pedestrian to the location of other park and recreation facilities in the vicinity</li><li><b>Gateway Elements</b> - San Diego has a history of providing unique gateway elements at a pedestrian scale that help to define neighborhoods. This design will continue that with that tradition by adding unique gateway elements that will define the three individual districts.</li><li><b>Building Signs</b> – creative signs on buildings are encourage to accent the pedestrian zone</li><li><b>Banners</b> - Banners on building facades and light poles can define the Promenade and add visual interest to the corridor</li></ul>'
				],
				[
					'text' => '<b>Street Crossings and Pedestrian Safety</b> - The design of the street crossings shall provide the maximum amount of security for the pedestrian. Bulb-outs are located at intersections to narrow the pedestrian crossing and shall be designed per the Streetscape Manual. Intersections shall have continental crosswalks to help define the pedestrian crossing.'
				],
				[
					'text' => '<b>Storm Water Treatment</b> - Bioswales will occur at locations throughout the promenade for storm water collection and cleansing.'
				],
				[
					'text' => '<b>Lighting</b> - Street Lights shall be provided per Streetscape Manual. Additional pedestrian lighting will be provided that complements existing lighting.'
				],
				[
					'text' => '<b>Artwork</b> - The 14th Street Promenade will ensure a place for public artwork, incorporating permanent and/or temporary art opportunities, allowing space for innovative; unique art in the public realm. These opportunities will be implemented by and/or in association with the City’s Commission for Arts and Culture, as funding becomes available.',
				],
				[
					'text' => '<b>Interpretive Elements</b> - Opportunity exists throughout the corridor to incorporate interpretive elements. They are placemakers, that define the neighborhood and represent the historical and cultural importance of the East Village. The interpretive elements can consist of signage, information panels, or cultural objects, such as the Bob Sinclair artifacts. They can be stand-alone pieces or incorporated in landscape, hardscape, gateway elements or art. The elements will be labeled with signage, to provide interest and value to the promenade.',
				],
				[
					'text' => '<p><h2>A SUSTAINABLE GREEN STREET</h2></p><p>Consistent with its designation as a Green Street, the 14th Street Promenade is oriented toward pedestrian uses with traffic-calming measures and enhanced planting. The design will further the Centre City Green program, which emphasizes the following:</p><ul><li>Transform downtown streets into places for people and not just for cars</li><li>Create healthier outdoor spaces that are more pedestrian- and bike-friendly, add more greenery, accommodate transit, use less energy and water, improve air quality and reduce storm water pollution</li><li>Devote less of the street right-of-way to vehicles and instead widen sidewalks</li><li>Where possible, incorporate low-impact development (LID) features that include storm water management systems</li><li>Use local and regional materials with high recycled content and energy-efficient pedestrian lighting.</li></ul><p>In addition, the 14th Street Promenade will utilize bioswales and porous paving to capture storm water from the roadway, sidewalks and rooftops of adjacent buildings. The bioswales will be planted with plant material appropriate for this condition and will be a prominent attractive feature of the 14th Street Promenade. Opportunity also exists for including interpretive elements within the bioswales to help the pedestrians appreciate the importance of stormwater quality.</p>',

If development follows the approved Community Plan and continues on its current course, East Village has the opportunity to be realized as a true urban neighborhood. A neighborhood in which people don’t just reside, but can walk to work and sustains a rich offering of entertainment, shopping, dining and recreation.</p>',
						],
						[
							'text' => '<p>As the Focus Plan was being prepared two overarching issues were recognized.</p>',
						],
						[
							'text' => '<p><b>1. Public Participation</b></p><p>We understand that any ambitious plan or vision must include a broad coalition of participation from both the public and private sectors. For example, the growth of the bio-tech and bio-pharmaceutical industries in San Diego is a direct result of then Mayor Pete Wilson’s leadership in using city land to incubate research-based businesses that emanated from UCSD(4). It took private business, venture capital, real estate development, public investment and leadership for this success to be realized.</p><p>For many reasons including demographic and social trends, concerns about creating sustainable communities, and generational preferences, the frontiers of the new economy are growing in the urban fabric of cities. A lot of investment has been already made in revitalizing downtown San Diego. We suggest that for downtown to achieve the jobs-housing balance originally envisioned, progress will <b>require all stakeholders at the table.</b></p><p>We hope that by providing this Focus Plan, we can add further fuel to the conversation.</p>',
						],
						[
							'text' => '<p><b>2. Timing</b></p><p>In the workshops, as well as one-on-one meetings, people have voiced their concerns about whether something like an innovation district could be realized without a major San Diego university or tech-oriented business making a significant commitment to anchor the district. They are concerned, and rightly so, that without investment on the part of the city or a major institution the full potential of the neighborhood, and indeed the downtown area will never occur.</p><p>We believe that between development already occurring, especially in IDEA District, the number of business start-ups in downtown, and the demographic make-up of downtown residents, that with the right focus and commitment, an emerging jobs-cluster can be realized more quickly than anyone anticipates. To put it into perspective, with the right incentives and investment downtown’s population grew 97% since the year 2000.(5)</p><p>Last year, the Downtown San Diego Partnership commissioned UC San Diego Extension to conduct demographic and economic study of downtown San Diego. In the study’s conclusion it states that “Downtown San Diego is one of the few major cities in America, and California, where there is still the potential to further expand a dynamic and a uniquely inclusive innovation economy.” It specifically highlights the “Available, developable land downtown, particularly in the East Village…contiguous to a number of diverse neighborhoods with developable land, including Barrio Logan, Golden Hill and the Diamond District”(6) as one of four primary reasons downtown is ripe for this effort.</p><p>The study in its entirety can be found at: http://www.downtownsandiego.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSDP-Demographic-Study-2016.pdf</p>',

						],
						[
							'text' => '<p><h3>1. Define A Unique Neighborhood</h3></p><p>The goal is to make the neighborhood <b>memorable and engaging.</b> Distinct physical cues and design elements will give the community a unique identity and distinguish it from other downtown neighborhoods. These can be predictable, like paving patterns and building materials, or unexpected and idiosyncratic, like a neighborhood shrub or a mandated wainscot on utility infrastructure.</p><p>It is equally important to <b>capitalize on the existing distinctive attributes</b> of the area. East Village South has nine academic institutions with more anticipated in the near future. It is also home to many small start-up companies. This area, with its share of warehouse structures and developable blocks is recognized as ideal for attracting companies in the high-tech, design and development fields. To realize success it must be cultivated and supported by public action and planning directives. If entities are supported, a powerful and exciting dynamic could energize the entire downtown and region.</p><p>The goal is to make the neighborhood memorable and engaging. You need to know you are in East Village South without signage.</p>'
						],
						[
							'text' => '<p><h3>2. Leverage The Academic Vibe</h3></p><p>One obvious and powerful idea is to build on and celebrate the Academic Vibe. Only East Village has <b>nine academic institutions with more coming.</b></p><p>East Village is one of the major educational clusters in the region. From elementary schools to high schools, college and post graduate work, all can be found in East Village. The focus and approach of many of the curriculums is on the Arts, Design and Innovation and they complement, and are complemented by, the same activities in the neighborhood.</p>'
						],
						[
							'text' => '<p><h3>3. Encourage & Nurture Employment</h3></p><p>Downtowns thrive when there is a robust and synergetic mix of job-generating uses, combined with residential, retail, public spaces, cultural attractions, great streets, etc. As stated in the introduction, the missing piece in downtown San Diego is the jobs engine. With the recent upsurge in entrepreneurial activity downtown, including 110 start-ups(7), now is the time to intentionally nurture and grow the next great San Diego companies. It was determined East Village South is the ideal location because land is available - much of it publicly-owned - and the innovation ecosystem in Upper East Village is starting to gain traction.</p><p>But matching the type of jobs to the resident profile most attracted to urban living, will be the real key. Currently downtown San Diego residents are educated (51% have a Bachelor or an advanced degree); they are mostly employed in management, business, science and the arts (55%) and earn an average income of $73,756. And, contrary to popular wisdom only 17% are single.(8)</p><p>Building on the robust education spine in East Village, the workshop participants indicated a strong desire to add additional higher education facilities in East Village South, and pair these idea creators with clean, high-paying technology companies that want to be near them. The job generation potential of combining these complementary users has been dramatically proven on the Torrey Pines Mesa, and in cities including Boston, Seattle, and San Francisco.</p><p>Furthermore East Village is adjacent to some of San Diegos most economically and environmentally disadvantaged communities. The absence of major university campuses south of San Diego State University further limits opportunity. Encouraging and nurturing high paying clean jobs, as well as the academic trajectory in East Village, holds promise for creating more opportunity for these communities. Moreover, high paying jobs associated with internet / mobile software technology are not limited to those with four year degrees. Many of these jobs are available to persons who have mastered code and other internet/mobile technology skills, either through informal apprenticeships or through interaction with other skilled persons. The combination of academia and high tech employers will create opportunity and boost incomes in adjacent communities without aggravating environmental problems in those communities.</p>'
						],
						[
							'text' => '<p><h3>4. Enhance Livability through Public Open Space</h3></p><p>As neighborhoods become denser, generous open space becomes more critical to livability. East Village South will soon be one of downtown’s <b>densest neighborhoods</b>, but has only one mid-sized park. The 14th Street Promenade Green Street with its widened sidewalk and enhanced landscaping will serve not only as the major north/ south connector but also greatly contribute to the public realm.</p><p>As the workshop participants noted, public spaces should adapt to “temporal” scale and uses. This means that they can be deliberately changed to meet the needs of the community; a food truck haven turns into pop-up work space turns into playground turns into public art exhibition.</p><p>This plan identifies opportunities for the new <b>major new open spaces</b> desperately needed in this neighborhood.</p>'
						],
						[
							'text' => '<p><h3>5. Connect Neighborhoods</h3></p><p>Enhancing and creating connections to surrounding neighborhoods is <b>a top priority and the timing is right.</b></p><p>The <b>14th Street Promenade</b>, if extended, will play a central role in connecting Barrio Logan to City College through the East Village neighborhoods. It is highly desirable to continue the connection through San Diego High School and to Balboa Park. <b>Island and “J” Streets</b> promise to be compelling and walkable east/west connector streets, but are blocked from connecting to Sherman Heights by Interstate 5. The Downtown Community Plan identifies that location for a <b>freeway lid.</b> This cover is an opportunity to create additional park space as well as affordable housing.</p><p>As stated previously, large monolithic developments like a stadium <b>creates walls rather than connections</b> and are inconsistent with the principles of both the Focus Plan and the current Downtown Community Plan.</p>'
						],
						[
							'text' => '<p><h3>6. Preserve View Corridors</h3></p><p>The views down the city streets to the bay and bridge give East Village a strong character. Walking along 13th Street, 14th Street, and 15th Street in the afternoon with the buildings in shadow and the Coronado Bridge alive in the afternoon <b>light is one of the qualities most cherished in the community.</b> These view corridors must be protected and enhanced if possible. The Focus Plan retains the 13th Street and 14th Street views and opens up 15th Street to an enhanced view of the bridge.</p>'

With over 3,000 housing units and supporting ground level retail under construction on nearby and adjacent sites, the market will shortly make moving the bus yards economically feasible. It has been estimated that seven years might be required to move them and clean the site. This may be good timing with regard to Phase One.</p><p>Similar to Phase One, a Master Developer would buy the entire site, select a particular parcel to develop, complete the below-grade parking and open space infrastructure as soon as possible, and sell off other parcels to different entities for development.</p><p>Unlike Phase One, this phase has a number of large tower sites. Because of the high rise foundation requirements, the master developer podium will only include the public areas. Each site will have a property line and developers will design and build accordingly while co ordinating their below grade parking levels to enable a functional common garage.</p><p>Although Phase One could (and should) begin tomorrow, the nine projects on bus yard/tailgate sites will likely take place over several decades. This is both realistic and desirable. The density envisioned will need time to absorb into the market. The sequential implementation by creative individual entities will contribute to the “authenticity” of the neighborhood just as the workshop participants imagined.</p>'
